# Bard.js
A webpanel based music bot for discord.

With the ability to select songs from uploaded albums, create playlists, and control playback, Bard.js was designed with Dungeons & Dragons gameplay in mind. No longer do you have to manipulate the currently playing music with a series of commands, now it's as easy as a press of a button.
